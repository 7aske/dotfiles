# dotfiles v2

## Description

Personal dotfiles and configs that I use on my Linux machines, primarily on Arch distributions.


## Usage

Dotfiles are located in the `.config` and are organized to match the `~/.config` folder in most Linux distributions. You can just copy them over or make symlinks to this folder. Linking `dotifles/.config` to your `~/.config` is not advised.

`.other` contains some Windows program's configurations I like to use.

`make`

Installs all dotfiles

`make zsh`

Installs dotfiles only for `zsh`
